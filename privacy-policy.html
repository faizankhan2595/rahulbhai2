                    <li>withdraw your consent to the processing of your Personal Data (where we are processing your Personal Data based on your consent);</li>
                    <li>request receipt or transmission to another organisation, in a machine-readable form, of the Personal Data that you have provided to us where we are using your Personal Data based on consent or performance of a contract; and&nbsp;</li>

                    <p>Where you are given the option to share your Personal Data with us, you can always choose not to do so. If we have requested your consent to processing and you later choose to withdraw it, we will respect that choice in accordance with our legal obligations.</p>
                    <p>However, choosing not to share your Personal Data with us or withdrawing your consent to our use of it could mean that we are unable to perform the actions necessary to achieve the purposes of processing described in Section II (Use of Personal Data) or that you are unable to make use of the Services. After you have chosen to withdraw your consent, we may be able to continue to process your Personal Data to the extent required or otherwise permitted by applicable laws and regulations.</p>

                    <p>Once verified, we will&nbsp;give&nbsp;effect&nbsp;to&nbsp;your request within the timelines prescribed by applicable laws.</p>
